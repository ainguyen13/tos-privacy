        <h2 id="section-7">7. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App may integrate or link to third-party services (for example, analytics, crash reporting, login providers, or payment processors).

        <h2 id="section-8">8. Suspension and Termination</h2>

        <h2 id="section-9">9. Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>The App is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and that the App will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free.</p>

        <h2 id="section-10">10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, revenues, data, or goodwill arising out of or related to your use of (or inability to use) the App.</p>

        <h2 id="section-12">12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. The updated version will be posted on this page and the “Last updated” date will be revised. Your continued use of the App after changes become effective means you accept the updated Terms.</p>

        <h2 id="section-13">13. Fees, Purchases, and Subscriptions</h2>
        <p>The App may offer paid features, digital content, or subscriptions (“Paid Services”). If you choose to purchase Paid Services, you agree to pay all applicable fees and taxes and to comply with any additional terms presented at the time of purchase.</p>
        <h3>13.1. Billing</h3>
        <p>Purchases may be processed through a third-party platform (for example, Apple App Store or Google Play). In that case, your billing relationship is with that platform, and their terms may apply in addition to these Terms.</p>
        <h3>13.2. Subscriptions and auto-renewal</h3>
        <p>If you purchase a subscription, it may renew automatically unless you cancel it before the renewal date. You can manage and cancel subscriptions through your account settings on the applicable platform.</p>
        <h3>13.3. Free trials and promotions</h3>
        <p>If we offer a free trial or promotional pricing, you must cancel before the trial ends to avoid being charged (if auto-renewal applies). Eligibility for trials and promotions may be limited (for example, one per account) and determined by the store platform.</p>
        <h3>13.3. Refunds</h3>
        <p>Refund requests are handled according to the policies of the platform that processed your payment (for example, Apple or Google). To the extent permitted by law, we do not provide refunds for purchases made through third-party platforms unless required by those policies or applicable law.</p>
        <h3>13.4. Price changes</h3>
        <p>Prices may change from time to time. If you have an auto-renewing subscription, the store platform may provide notice of price changes and may require you to take action before the new price applies, depending on the platform’s policies and your region.</p>

        <h2 id="section-14">14. App Updates and Availability</h2>
        <p>We may modify, update, or discontinue the App (or any part of it) at any time, including adding or removing features. We do not guarantee that the App will always be available, uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free.</p>
        <p>You are responsible for keeping your device and app version up to date. Some features may not function properly if you do not install updates.</p>

        <h2 id="section-15">15. Feedback</h2>

        <h2 id="section-16">16. Copyright Complaints</h2>

        <h2 id="section-17">17. Governing Law; Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws applicable in your operating jurisdiction, without regard to conflict-of-law principles, unless a mandatory law provides otherwise.</p>
        <p>If a dispute arises, you agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute informally. If we cannot resolve the dispute, either party may pursue remedies available under applicable law.</p>
        <h3>17.1. Severability</h3>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.</p>
        <h3>17.2. Entire Agreement</h3>
        <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding your use of the App, except where additional terms apply to specific features.</p>
